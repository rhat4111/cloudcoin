            CloudCoin shares many great characteristics with other cryptocurrencies such as data supremacy and being
            virtually impossible to counterfeit. Both RAIDA and Blockchain solve the physical integrity problem found in
            digital currencies. Blockchain gains its physical integrity from being mirrored on thousands of "mining"
            servers. The RAIDA gets its physical integrity from being shredded and sent to twenty-five independent
            clouds located in different geopolitical jurisdictions worldwide.

              While Bitcoin is perceived as private and decentralized, there are many copies of the central ledger

              As of December 31st, 2020, the University of Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index estimated
              that Bitcoin miners were using 264 gigawatts daily (source). This rate of energy consumption could power
              about 6 million Texas homes on a hot summer
              day (source).

            CloudCoin has a decentralized authentication network instead of miners calculating useless math. This system
            is so efficient, it renders the energy usage per transaction negligible. The entire RAIDA network uses less
            electricity than the average home.
            This efficiency empowers the public with the ability to conduct transactions with no additional fees!

              Owning a Bitcoin wallet requires downloading the over 300 Gigabyte (and growing) central ledger blockchain
              (source). The growth of the blockchain will accelerate further if there is a mass adoption of Bitcoin in
              regular commerce. This would make owning
              a personal wallet on a typical personal computer impossible. Enthusiasts will point to “Moore’s Law,”
              stating the number of transistors in a microchip doubles every two years which characterized advancements
              in technology for
              about 50 years (source). However, many experts agree this law is now dead as advancements have slowed in
              recent years (source) portending the end of the Bitcoin wallet.

              Blockchain uses public key encryption that is not quantum-safe, according to the US NIST (National

              encryption, and would take a supercomputer 10’s of
              thousands of years to break. It is predicted that a quantum computer could break this in a matter hours or

              Crypto enthusiasts are familiar with the stories of people irretrievably losing fortunes in mishaps like
              7,500 Bitcoins lost by accidentally discarding the wrong hard drive (source), 850,000 Bitcoins stolen by
              hackers from the Mt Gox exchange (source),
              6,000 Bitcoins lost by mistakenly discarding the offline printed key (source), among many other
              unfortunate stories (source). Experts predict 4.4 million of the18.3 million Bitcoins mined are now
              forever lost and about 1,500
              Bitcoins are lost daily (source).

            If you are willing to register your email by encrypting it into your CloudCoins and keep a record of your

            are lost forever as they will eventually
            cycle back for the RAIDA system administrators to recover. This helps cover the costs of sustaining and

            <p class="description">
              Bitcoin is not easily divisible in a fashion that people can quickly comprend relative to the government
              currencies with which they are accustomed. For instance, one can quickly appreciate whether or not they
              are getting a fair deal if a latte costs $5
              or the latest iPhone is $999. But if those same prices are in Bitcoin (as of 12/31/20), that latte is
              0.00017 and the iPhone is 0.034. This is substantially more difficult to interpret without a calculator.

            CloudCoin uses only whole numbers (integers) that people can more easily understand. To keep the currency
            functional as the value increases, a split will happen, multiplying your CloudCoins in number, preserving
            it’s utility as a currency by staying in
            the same relative range of purchasing power. For example, when CloudCoin is sustained at $2, a 1:100 split
            will automatically occur, multiplying the CloudCoins by 100 and reducing the CloudCoin value to $0.02. This
            means if you
            had 10 CloudCoins worth $2 a piece, you will now have 1,000 CloudCoins worth $0.02 apiece, an equal value.
