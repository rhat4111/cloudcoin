          The RAIDA is a new authentication protocol that is the first of its kind and the first true Cloud-based
          authentication system. Most authentication protocols require one password to be given to one server that is
          checked against one database. The RAIDA uses many passwords against many different servers each with a
          no-share database. The CloudCoin Consortium's RAIDA consists of 25 clouds of 32 servers, each located in over
          30 different countries (and growing). This allows us to have decentralized authentication, fault tolerance,
          high availability, and tamper-proof data. We call this property "Data Supremacy," and only the Blockchain, DNS
          and the RAIDA have achieved this.

            RAIDA is a global counterfeit detection system that is indestructible and cannot be tampered with or hacked.
            Neither nuclear bombs, comet strikes, world wars, dictatorships nor government hackers can bring down RAIDA.
            Quantum safe, self-healing, simple, fast, and reliable, RAIDA can detect the authenticity of a CloudCoin
            within milliseconds.<br><br> Why is the RAIDA Quantum safe? It is quantum-safe for a few reasons. The first
            reason is that it does not have a public ledger. , and everyone can try to decrypt it. RAIDA is not
            public.<br><br> The second is that if you were to capture one of the RAIDA servers, you would only have 1/32
            of 1/25th of the authentication data. So, if you were able to decrypt it would not give you ownership of any
            coins.<br><br> In order to crack a CloudCoin, you would need to guess the Authenticity Numbers of a majority
            of the RAIDA. Each Authenticity number uses a 16-byte password that is 100% random. They RAIDA has a
            bottleneck of how many guesses can be done each second. The public ledger does not have a bottleneck. With a
            public ledger, we could make as many guesses as we have servers. If a hacker has a football field full of
            supercomputers (like the NSA), then they could guess trillions of combinations per second. With quantum
            computers, a hacker could guess all combinations within two minutes and crack the Blockchain. With RAIDA, we
            can only guess 8 million per second per RAIDA. This means that it would take more guesses than there is the
            time in the Universe and the RAIDA is quantum-safe.<br><br> The significance of the RAIDA is that now there
            is a global authentication system that people can trust to be Confidential, Available, and has integrity.
            So, everyone can use it to authenticate whatever they like and create their own domain controllers (RAIDA
            Realms) and extend permissions and rights to whatever network resources (servers) they control. </p>

                The essence of money is that it cannot be counterfeited allowing us to track who among us has done work
                and created value for the economy. CloudCoin takes trust to the highest level ever. Using the
                patent-pending RAIDA technologies (The patent is to keep others from locking us out of the technology),
                independent system administrators from all around the world leverage thousands of servers and networks
                to create an unbreakable system that nobody and nothing can dictate. Note that the RAIDA does not
                create, store, transmit, track or broker CloudCoins. The only function of each RAIDA Cloud is to detect
                the authenticity of a CloudCoin.

                all data passed between the web server and browsers remain private and integral. SSL allows you to know
                that the servers you connect to are in fact, the servers that you want to connect to. RAIDA only uses
                HTTP Strict Transport Security and only passes data that is impossible to infer. RAIDA's HTTPS usage is
                scientifically un-hackable, and there are no known vulnerabilities.

                a content delivery server. Our CDN also provides DDoS protection (our enterprise-class DDoS protection
                network has 20 times more capacity than the largest DDoS attack ever recorded.) Our CDN provides the

                that they cannot be compromised. Layers of reverse proxy servers can be added to make things even more
                secure. This is kind of like a Tor network except the RAIDA has 25 Tor networks owned privately by 25
                different organizations.

                Each RAIDA network is composed of many redundant servers, networks, and databases. Such arrangements of
                hardware are often referred to as Clouds. No matter what components fail or are attacked, the system
                keeps going. The databases are mirrored in several different physical locations. There are teams of Web
                servers for high availability. Multiple locations allow for catastrophic failures (such as a meteor
                strike), yet the system can stay operational. It is highly likely that the RAIDA Clouds will become the
                target of thousands of highly trained hackers from around the world. However, the RAIDA Clouds will
                survive.

      <p class="description">
        Each CloudCoin can be sliced into 25 parts. There are 25 sub-clouds (called "crypts"). Each is responsible for
        one CloudCoin slice. One Sentinel cluster guards each crypt. The Sentinel clusters hide behind Content
        Management Systems. Sentinels are dispersed around the world in mostly liberal countries. The Sentinel IP
        addresses are hidden, and only the Content Management Systems know their IPs. The Sentinels each hold a
        directory of all the IP addresses of the detection agents in their crypt. Only the Sentinels know the IP
        addresses of the detection agents, so the locations of the detection agents are obscured. The Sentinels will
        query the Detection Agents on behalf of the CloudCoins to detect Counterfeits and fix fracked coins.<br><br>

        Current locations of Sentinel Servers: Australia, Macedonia, Philippines, Serbia, Switzerland, South Korea,
        Japan, UK, India (x3), Germany (x2), USA (x3), Taiwan, Russia (x2), France (x2), Singapore, Argentina, Canada.

        Each Sentinel and Detection Agent is controlled by a different person. Each Sentinel may use a different
        algorithm for dividing the load among the Detection Agents. Some Sentinels may shard (divide by rows) the
        CloudCoin authentication data between the Detection Agents. Some Sentinels may use a hash or random lookup table
        to divide the load. Detection Agents may not know the serial numbers of the CloudCoins that they are detecting.
        When random lookup tables are used, it is impossible for RAIDA administrators to assemble the CloudCoins back
        together. Only Sentinels can do this.

        RAIDA Self-Repair Protocol<br>
        (Triple Kerberos)
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        Sometimes, the Sentinels will be unavailable. When unavailable, Sentinels are restored or replaced. The
        CloudCoins can repair them because all the authenticity data is stored in the CloudCoins themselves. The repair
        protocol cloud is called "Triple Kerberos" because it uses three tickets. Kerberos is a network authentication
        protocol that works on the basis of 'tickets' to allow nodes communicating over a non-secure network to prove
        their identity to one another in a secure manner. It is designed to provide strong authentication for
        client/server applications by using secret-key cryptography. </p>

        Conclusion
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        The RAIDA does everything that the Blockchain does, only much faster, more reliable and far more efficiently.
        The RAIDA
        is, and more nodes and networks can be brought on to perform all the world's transactions within milliseconds.
        Work is
        distributed amount more nodes instead of requiring each node to do more work (like Blockchain). The cost of
        electricity
        and operation is 3000 times less than the Blockchain. All data can be stored in RAM. The RAIDA is 100% quantum
        safe and
        does not use encryption. The system is fault-tolerant and can withstand government attacks, natural disasters,
        hackers,
        and even internal subversion. The RAIDA is ready for retail and does not require any client download except for
        a
        webpage or small client software (under 1 megabyte).
